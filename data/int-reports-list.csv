And the timing is excellent: education has long been critical to human welfare, but it is even more so in a time of rapid economic and social change. The best way to equip children and youth for the future is to place their learning at the center. The 2018 WDR explores four main themes: 1) education’s promise; 2) the need to shine a light on learning; 3) how to make schools work for learners; and 4) how to make systems work for learning."

PIRLS 2021 will provide data on trends in comparative reading achievement across countries over two decades. Since 2001, PIRLS has been conducted every five years at the fourth grade. ePIRLS, an innovative assessment of online informational reading, was introduced in 2016 as an optional component. Reading literacy is the foundation for academic success, and PIRLS is a valuable vehicle for studying whether new or revised policies impact achievement. The PIRLS reading assessment is based on a comprehensive framework that covers major reading purposes — for literary experience, to acquire and use information, and to search for information on the internet."
